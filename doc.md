# GSLLua
## Introduction
This is a binding for the GSL library. It exposes some of the GSL library routines and data types as a few easy-to-use module functions and wrapper objects. The module attempts to shield 

Currently, it includes support for vectors and matrices, 
numerical integration, interpolation and least-squares fitting.

GSLLua has been tested with Lua 5.1.4 and LuaJIT 2.0 (beta 6).

## Installation
This module requires the following libraries to be installed in the Lua module searchpath:

* [Alien](http://alien.luaforge.net/) (installable through [LuaRocks](http://luarocks.org/))
* [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) (through your package manager, or MacPorts for Mac OS X)

Run the make.lua script to compile the library and install it. 

## License
GSLLua is a wrapper for GSL, therefore inherits the [GPL licence](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
